        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PuzzleLicious ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>PuzzleLicious is designed with privacy in mind. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not require you to create an account or sign in.</li>
            <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any other personal identifiers.</li>
            <li>We do not track your location.</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts, camera, or microphone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Photos</h2>
        <p>If you choose to use your own images to create puzzles, those images are accessed only on your device and are never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with us or any third party.</p>

        <h2>Puzzle Data</h2>
        <p>Your puzzle progress is saved locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to any server and remains entirely under your control.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>PuzzleLicious offers in-app purchases through Apple's App Store. All purchase transactions are handled entirely by Apple. We do not collect or have access to your payment information. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how Apple handles purchase data.</p>

        <h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports. This helps us identify and fix bugs to improve app stability. Crash reports may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
            <li>App version</li>
            <li>Crash logs and stack traces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. No personal information is included in crash reports.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> (Google) — for anonymous crash reporting. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> — for processing in-app purchases. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PuzzleLicious does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app does not require any personal data to function.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data to retain. Puzzle progress stored locally on your device can be deleted by uninstalling the app.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
